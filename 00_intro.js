// javascript or js is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is widely used for web development. 
// It was created by Brendan Eich in 1995 and has since become one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. 
// JavaScript is an event-driven, functional, and imperative language that allows developers to create interactive and dynamic web pages.
// It can be used for both client-side and server-side development, making it a versatile language for building web applications. 
// JavaScript is supported by all modern web browsers and has a large ecosystem of libraries and frameworks, such as React, Angular, and Vue.js
// which help developers build complex applications more easily.

//javascript is also used for server-side development using Node.js, which allows developers to run JavaScript on the server or their local machine.
// Node.js is built on the V8 JavaScript engine and provides a runtime environment for executing JavaScript code outside of a web browser.
// This enables developers to build scalable and high-performance applications using JavaScript on the server side.
// JavaScript is also known for its asynchronous programming capabilities, allowing developers to handle tasks like network requests and file I/O without blocking the main thread.
// This is achieved through the use of callbacks, promises, and async/await syntax, which makes it easier to write and manage asynchronous code.
// synchronous programming is a programming paradigm that allows multiple tasks to be executed concurrently, improving performance and responsiveness in applications.
// JavaScript supports synchronous programming through the use of callbacks, promises, and async/await syntax
// which allows developers to write non-blocking code that can handle multiple tasks simultaneously.

// JavaScript has a large and active community, which contributes to its popularity and growth.
// The language is continuously evolving, with new features and improvements being added through the ECMAScript specification.

// javascript versions are named ES1, ES2, ES3, ES4, ES5, ES6, and so on.
// ES6 is the sixth edition of the ECMAScript language specification and was released in 2015.
// It introduced many new features and improvements to the language, making it more powerful and easier to use.
// ES6 is also known as ECMAScript 2015 and is widely supported by modern browsers and JavaScript engines.
// ES7 is the seventh edition of the ECMAScript language specification and was released in 2016.
// â€‹As of April 2025, the latest official version of JavaScript is ECMAScript 2024 (ES15), which was finalized in June 2024. 


// JavaScript runs linearly, meaning that it executes code in the order it is written.
// This means that if you have a long-running operation, it can block the execution of other code until it is completed.
// To avoid this, JavaScript uses an event loop and a callback queue to manage asynchronous operations.
// This allows JavaScript to handle multiple tasks concurrently without blocking the main thread.
// The event loop continuously checks the callback queue for any pending tasks and executes them when the main thread is free.
// This allows JavaScript to handle multiple tasks concurrently without blocking the main thread.

console.log("Hello World!"); // prints "Hello World!" to the console
console.log('Hello World!'); // prints "Hello World!" to the console
console.log(`Hello World!`); // prints "Hello World!" to the console but using template literals
console.warn("Hello World!"); // prints "Hello World!" to the console with a warning icon
console.error("Hello World!"); // prints "Hello World!" to the console with an error icon
console.info("Hello World!"); // prints "Hello World!" to the console with an info icon
console.debug("Hello World!"); // prints "Hello World!" to the console with a debug icon
console.clear(); // clears the console

console.table("Hello World!"); // prints "Hello World!" to the console in a table format
console.table([1, 2, 3]); // prints an array of numbers in a table format
console.table({ 
  name: "Khushi",
  lastName: "Yadav",
  age: 15
}); // prints an object in a table format
